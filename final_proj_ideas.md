This is a place to jot down some final project ideas.
The final project website must have:
	1) ability to have and allow the creation of users/profiles.
	2) the user must have a site that they own, and can personalize.
	3) each user must be able to have a site to share, that others can see without changing.
	4) other users cannot change different users sites.
I think those are the only requirements. I right now don't have any real ideas.
