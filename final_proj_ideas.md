This is a place to jot down some final project ideas.
The final project website must have:
	1) ability to have and allow the creation of users/profiles.
	2) the user must have a site that they own, and can personalize.
	3) each user must be able to have a site to share, that others can 
    see without changing. (I think that is a requirement...)
	4) other users cannot change different users sites.
I think those are the only requirements. I right now don't have any real ideas.

IDEAS: 

 I was thinking of making a site that would hold other people's sites. My thought is that 
 in school every class has like 3 websites that you have to keep track of. This website would allow users 
 to create quarters (or semesters) that have a classes and the classes have the sites saved for each class. 
 Then the user could save the names/labels for the website, and of course edit these and stuff. I don't know
 it's just an idea. I am not sure how
